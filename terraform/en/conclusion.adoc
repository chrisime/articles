= Conclusion

With its easy-to-understand syntax, Terraform focuses on the essentials. Namely, the "configuration" of cloud and on-premise infrastructures. With only very few elements, the desired results can be achieved in a short time. At the same time, the entire infrastructure is documented. Unless changes are made manually to the infrastructure, you can be sure that the state which is persisted locally is that of the configuration instance. As I mentioned in the article, Terraform is not always the first choice. Depending on the case, it must be decided whether it is not better to use another _IaC_ tool.
